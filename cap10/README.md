# Abstract
In this last chapter, we exhibit the power of the methods described earlier, by analysing five datasets. We start in section 10.2 with the two sets of income data from section 1.4. Without explanatory variables  we found the log transformation for the former, while the analysis of the latter remained inconclusive. When explanatory variables are included, and outliers deleted, the square-root transformation is indicated for both. In section 10.4  we analyse 1711 responses to a survey on customer loyalty, in which there are six explanatory variables. Parametric methods lead to $\sqrt{y}$ as the response, the identification of 41 outliers and a skewed distribution of residuals. RAVAS followed by the FS provides a good approximation to normally distributed errors, when only nine observations are deleted. Despite transformation and outlier detection, the $t$-statistics for the significance of the variables hardly change. Accordingly, in section 10.5  we modify 25 observations: monitoring plots reveal the  outliers and the results of the RAVAS analysis are close to those for the uncontaminated data. Finally, we analyse  the ``NCI-60`` cancer cell  data (Chapter 9).
With only seven explanatory variables, we monitor LS diagnostics, detect outliers and  apply RAVAS, which gives the best fitting model. The generalized candlestick plot provides further model selection.
