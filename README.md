# Applied Robust Statistics through the Monitoring Approach: Applications in Regression
GitHub repo of the forthcoming book "Applied Robust Statistics through the Monitoring Approach: 
Applications in Regression" Heidelberg: Springer Nature. by 
Atkinson,A.C., Riani,M., Corbellini,A., Perrotta D., and Todorov,V. (2024), 


**Reproducible Research (run in MATLAB on line or see Jupyter notebook file with attached output)**

All the figures and tables in the books can be reproduced.
For each Chapter each .m file can be run in MATLAB on line click on the Run in MATLAB on line button.
Moreover each .m file has the corresponding .ipynb file where 
it is possible to see the preview of the output the .m file generates.

All the README.m files in each Chapter have been automatically created  
by FSDA function [[m2ipynb](http://rosa.unipr.it/FSDA/m2ipynb.html)]
