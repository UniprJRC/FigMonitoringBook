# Abstract
The chapter explores five extensions to the regression model considered in earlier chapters. Section~\ref{cap8:introsec} introduces the use of prior knowledge in regression analysis, including the construction of prior distributions from fictitious observations. In \S\ref{cap8:compsec} Bayesian regression is combined with the FS.  Section~\ref{cap8:dataanal} provides analyses of successive annual sets of  trade data, in which the prior distribution is updated annually. Heteroskedastic regression is introduced in \S\ref{cap8:hetero}. The analysis of trade data makes clear the importance of avoiding models in which the variance goes to zero as $x$ does. Section~\ref{cap8:RobRegClust} extends the analysis of trade data  to data from several regression lines. The number of groups  is estimated in \S\ref{cap8:FS_random-start} from an FS which starts the search many times from random  points. Regression clustering (\S\ref{cap8:CLR_concepts}) involves the choice of  parameters and, for robustness, a choice of  trimming level.  The monitoring approach in \S\ref{cap8:CLR_monitoring} identifies solutions which do not depend on arbitrary choices of these hyper-parameters.  The fourth extension, in \S\ref{ch8:RobTimeSeries}, is to use monitoring to provide a robust model for short term economic time series that may have strong annual trends. The final extension, in \S\ref{CAP8lab-compositional}, is to regression in which the explanatory variables are the components of a composition or mixture.
