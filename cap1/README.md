Fig. 1.1. MAD: Empirical and asymptotic consistency factor under the hypothesis of normality.
The decreasing curve represents the reciprocal of the average value of the MAD across 100000
simulations [Code](https://github.com/UniprJRC/FigMonitoringBook/blob/main/cap1/MADsmallsample.m).

Fig. 1.2. Univariate income data from the United States Census Bureau: histogram and boxplot;
positive skewness is evident in both panels  [Code](https://github.com/UniprJRC/FSDApapers/blob/main/ARC2021/ChenLockhartStephensFigures.m).

Fig. 1.3. Univariate income data from United States Census Bureau: boxplots for four values of 𝜆
using the normalized Box Cox power transformation after preliminary rescaling of the data to a
maximum value of one [Code](https://github.com/UniprJRC/FSDApapers/blob/main/ARC2021/JohnDraperFigures.m).

Fig. 1.4. Univariate income data from the United States Census Bureau: monitoring the truncated
mean as a function of the trimming proportion 𝛼 [Code](https://github.com/UniprJRC/FSDApapers/blob/main/ARC2021/PoisonDataFigures.m).

Fig. 1.5. Univariate income data from the United States Census Bureau: monitoring plot of the
score test statistics for five values of 𝜆 as a function of the subset size 𝑚 [Code](https://github.com/UniprJRC/FSDApapers/blob/main/ARC2021/PoisonDataFigures.m).

Fig. 1.6. Univariate income data from a municipality in north of Italy: monitoring plot of the score
test statistics for four values of 𝜆 as a function of the subset size 𝑚 [Code](https://github.com/UniprJRC/FSDApapers/blob/main/ARC2021/PoisonDataFigures.m).
